# TinyGPT/LoadBalancer

This is a mirror of the ChatGPT application, which is a chatbot that can answer various questions related to general knowledge, entertainment, and more. In this version, we have implemented a load balancer based on minikube, which allows for better distribution of traffic among the available pods.

## Features

- Chatbot functionality: users can ask questions and receive answers from the chatbot.
- Load balancer: traffic is distributed among multiple pods to prevent overload on any single pod.
- Scalability: additional pods can be added easily to handle increased traffic.
